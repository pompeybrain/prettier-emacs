* Prettier for Emacs

** Intro
   This package is not official prettier emacs plugin
   I just refer the official plugin: [[https://github.com/prettier/prettier-emacs] [prettier-emacs]] code
   and create my package

** Feature
   + better customize for prettier default config options
   + wise prettier config priority
   + support vscode setting about prettier
   + support .prettierignore file

** Config Priority
   1. prettier config file in project directory
   2. vscode settings about prettier in project directory (should set ~prettier-use-vscode-config~ to ~t~ first)
   3. emacs prettier default options customized by use customize-group

** Requirements
  globally install prettier and can use in execpath
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  prettier -v
  #+END_SRC
  or install prettier locally in your project

** Usage
   download prettier.el file and add it to your emacs loadpath
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (require 'prettier)
   (global-prettier-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC
   format command: ~prettier-format~ only works in ~prettier-support-modes~

** Customization
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   M-x customize-group prettier
   #+END_SRC
   + ~prettier-support-modes~ the major-mode in it, when global-prettier-mode is on, will format before save
   + ~prettier-support-modes-alist~ the associat list of major-mode and prettier parser, you can reset it
